# Amazon SageMaker Workshop

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. In this workshop, you'll create a SageMaker notebook instance and work through sample Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate some of the many features of SageMaker.  Along the way you'll see how machine learning can be applied to both structured and unstructured data.  Please complete Module 1, Creating a Notebook Instance, right away when the workshop begins before the introduction presentation, so your notebook instance will be ready when the presentation ends and the hands on portion of the workshop starts.  

## Prerequisites

### AWS Account

In order to complete this workshop you'll need an AWS Account with access to create AWS IAM, S3 and SageMaker resources. The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one student is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another student, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around these by appending a unique suffix to the resources that fail to create due to conflicts, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work.

Some of the resources you will launch as part of this workshop are eligible for the AWS free tier if your account is less than 12 months old. See the [AWS Free Tier page](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) for more details.  We are also providing a credit for the workshop.

### Browser

We recommend you use the latest version of Chrome to complete this workshop.

## Modules

This workshop is broken up into multiple modules. Module 1 must be completed first.  We recommend you complete the other modules in order, however, you are welcome to skip ahead.  

1. Creating a Notebook Instance
2. NOTEBOOK 1
2. NOTEBOOK 2
3. NOTEBOOK 3

After you have completed the workshop you can delete all of the resources that were created by following the instructions at the end of each notebook ( NOTE:  SHOULD WE PROVIDE A CLEANUP GUIDE INSTEAD? ).
